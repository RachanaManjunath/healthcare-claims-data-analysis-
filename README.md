# Healthcare Claims Data Analysis

## Background: 
We are in the process of onboarding a new data provider to our data marketplace. They have just sent over their first file of sample claims for January 2021. We need to generate some basic statistics as well as review the file for overall data quality. Attached you will find a table definition document with a list of all the tables/datasets used.

### Question 1
1. What are the top 5 most common valid procedure codes?
2. How many patients are associated with at least one of those procedures?
Please do not use the result values from 1a - provide code that will find
the answer without specifying explicitly those code values.
### Question 2
What are the top 5 most common valid diagnosis codes?
### Question 3
We need to review this file for overall data quality and highlight any potential
problems so that they can be discussed with the data provider. Write a series of
tests that will identify any errors in the file and provide a list of all errors found. Do
not consider any medical details of the treatments, this question does not require
any healthcare knowledge.
These quality checks should include, but are not limited to
1.  Sample data matches the table definition
2.  All standardized codes are valid based on given reference material
3.  Date values are logical and chronological trending is consistent
